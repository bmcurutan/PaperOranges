### Text Editing
- Preferences > Text Editing > Editing
    - Checkmark "Automatically trim trailing whitespace" 
    - "Including whitespace-only lines"
- Preferences > Text Editing > Indentation
    - Set "Prefer Indent Using Spaces"
    - Set "Tab Width" and "Indent Width" to 4
    - Checkmark "Indent when typing" and all sub-checkboxes.

## Setup
// TODO

## Github
- `master` branch is what is released in the App Store
- `develop` branch is what is in development
- `master` and `develop` are protected branches, so a PR is needed to merge code into them
